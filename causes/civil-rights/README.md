  With immigrant rights, trans justice, reproductive freedom, and more at risk, we’re in courts and communities across the country to protect everyone’s rights — and we need you with us.

  With your help, we’re standing up for the most vulnerable people in society – those who have no other champion. We’re exposing hate and injustice, fighting discrimination, and providing award-winning anti-bias materials – free of charge – to schools across America.


- [NAACP](https://www.naacp.org/)

  We envision an inclusive community rooted in liberation where all persons can exercise their civil and human rights without discrimination. We are committed to a world without racism where Black people enjoy equitable opportunities in thriving communities.

  Through our detailed research and determined campaigning, we help fight abuses of human rights worldwide. We bring torturers to justice. Change oppressive laws. And free people jailed just for voicing their opinion.
