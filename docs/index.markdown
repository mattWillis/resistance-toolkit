## What is the Resistance Toolkit?
In the wake of all of the hatred being unleashed by politicians, it's easy to get overwhelmed and shut down. But please don't, that's what they are hoping we'll do!

I created this project to help myself get organized and come up with solid action items that I could work on. My hope is that this project can help you as well. We need to get organized in order to make a difference and defeat hate. 


**_Note:_** This implementation is primarily focused on U.S. politics and issues, but after some feedback I am working on an international version of this toolkit, because hate is obviously a global issue.

## How to use it?

1. Pick [a cause](#organizations--causes) that you are passionate about.

2. Stay informed by following organizations that deal with your cause on social media or subscribing to their mailing lists.
3. Pick a couple of [concrete actions](#tools) you can take to support your cause. Or create your own tools to help yourself and others take action. 
4. [Take a break and recover](#recovery): this is a marathon, not a sprint! 
5. Repeat: start back at step 1.
