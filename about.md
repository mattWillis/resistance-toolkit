## What is the Resistance Toolkit?
Are you feeling as overwhelmed and ready to shut down as I am in the wake of all of the hatred being unleashed by politicians? 

Feeling hopeless, I realized I needed a way to channel my frustration into meaningful action. So I am developing the Resistance Toolkit in an attempt to turn outrage into progress. The mission is to create a process: pick a cause, take an action, recover, and repeat. This seemed more achievable to me then attempting to somehow tackle all of the issues at once.

I know that together, we can transform feelings of hopelessness into a movement for change. Let's build something that fights hate, one action at a time.

**_Note:_** This implementation is primarily focused on **U.S. politics and issues**, but after some feedback I am working on an international version of this toolkit, because hate is obviously a global issue.

## But, why on GitHub?

First off, I think it's a misconception that GitHub is just for code. In fact,  [GitHub's FAQ section](https://github.com/frequently-asked-questions) plainly state that's it's not just for code. Git is a version control system, which is very popular with software developers, but not nessisarily _just_ for code. 

I chose to host this MVP (minimal viable product) version of The Resistance Toolkit on GitHub for a couple of reasons:

1. **Open Source:** It's important to me that this project is open sourced. The goal is to foster a community of passionate and active people to help develop and maintain this project. 
2. **Rapid Development:** Things are changing at an incredible pace. It seems like everyday there is a new executive order and a new cause under threat. I want to be able to be nimble, test out new strategies, and gauge interest in this concept before committing to a fully fledged application.
