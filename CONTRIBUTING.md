# Introduction
Thank you for your help in making the Resistance Toolkit relevant and useful. Please take a minute to review the contribution guidelines set out in this document before creating any issues.

This is a WIP, please check back periodically as I will be updating this document frequently! 

## What types of contributions can you make?
My goal is to ensure all content in this repository is accurate, up to date, and is representative of the mission to provide tools to resist hatred. The following are the types of contributions that will be accepted. 

### Harmful Content
Create an issue with the `harmful content` label. Please be specific about the content in question and provide an explanation and/or evidence to support your claim.


__I will not__ accept personal opinions as a reason for removal of content. Please back up your claim with real proof (an article from a reputable news agency, a scientific paper, a law suit, etc).


Examples of harmful content: 
- A featured organization has been found to be fraudulent, misleading, or spreading hate.
- Suggestion or information listed that is in fact either harmful or not effective.

### Organization Suggestion
Create an issue with the `organization suggestion` label. Please provide a link to the organization, a category that falls under, and a quick description or mission statement. 

### Enhancement
Is there a feature you'd like to see created or added to the Resistance Toolkit? Create an issue with the `enhancement` label. I will add accepted enhancement requests to the development roadmap. 

### Spelling / Grammar
I am notoriously horrible at spelling... auto-correct is just about the only way I survive. Please use the `spelling / grammar` label to make spelling corrections or suggestions on better grammatical syntax. 


## Contributions I am not looking for.

At this point I am not looking contributor members, pull requests, or help in maintaining this resource. However that might change depending on the amount of feedback I receive. I will let you know.
