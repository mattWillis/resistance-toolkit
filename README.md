<!-- ## All the tools you need to resist hate.  -->

![Logo for The Resistance Toolkit stylized as graffiti on a brick wall. Subtitle reads "The tools you need to resist hate."](assets/Banner.png)

In the wake of all of the hatred being unleashed by politicians, it's easy to get overwhelmed and shut down. But please don't, that's what they are hoping we'll do! 


1. Pick [a cause](#organizations--causes) that you are passionate about.
2. Stay informed on the issues surrounding your cause.
3. Try to come up with a couple of [concrete actions](#tools) you can take to support your cause.
4. [Take breaks and recover](#recovery): this is a marathon, not a sprint! Find a relaxing hobby or take news and social media breaks. 
5. Repeat: start back at step 1.
